What I learned from following this tutorial:
    - I learnt a lot about using control nodes and position them, helping with using
    - I learnt some stuff about inheritance on the script level
    - [Part 4 on tutorial]I learn about unhandled_ui_input, in which it is the catches all the input that doesn't occur on the UI layer, meaning you use it when you can to listen for mouse input. 
    You use this when you want to click on an object, this won't work initially because Control > Mouse > Filter = Stop. So you need to change this to ontrol > Mouse > Filter = Ignore.
    - [Part 4 on tutorial] I learnt how to click on an object and take it with you and it will show up and follow you mouse.
    - I learnt some aspects of themes in Godot
    - I learnt how he managed game scenes with a Scenehandler node, which is the start node that you run. This node runs all the scenes so it will load main_menu at the start and then it will
    handle the game level scenes, so it will handle everything related to the scenes and its changing process.
